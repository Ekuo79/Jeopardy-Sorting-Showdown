# Jeopardy-Sorting-Showdown

Welcome to Jeopardy Sorting Showdown, a fun and interactive web application designed to help you practice and improve your knowledge using Jeopardy questions.

As a custom project for my Data Structures and Algorithms class, this app retrieves and loads the questions by comparing the sorting time of heap sort and quick sort.
